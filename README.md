# data-science-journal

Welcome to **Data Science Journal**, a personal space where I document what I learn, explore, and build in the world of data science.

This journal serves two purposes:  
🧠 to track and deepen my own learning  
📖 to help others understand and grow through shared knowledge

Here, you’ll find clear explanations, practical examples, and thoughtful reflections on a range of topics — from Python fundamentals and data libraries, to real-world machine learning and analysis.
